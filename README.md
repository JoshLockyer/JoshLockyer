Welcome to my GitHub page!
I'm a PhD student in Theoretical Physics at the University of Graz.
I am investigating phenomenology and simulation of experiment signatures from a variety of dark sector models. It is my hope to make these models more theoretically consistent - this will require a lot of math! 
This page contains some investigations of Monte Carlo simulations. I hope you enjoy the time you spend here!
